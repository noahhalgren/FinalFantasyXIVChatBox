3. **VERY IMPORTANT!!** Replace the custom CSS box with the following CSS:

```
html,body { font-size: 14px; }
img.emote { width: 14px; }
```

**If you skip this step, the background will not be transparent**. Additionally, you can modify the text size and emote size by adjusting the px numbers in this field.
